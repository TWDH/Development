1. Tell me something about yourself.

   - ```
     My name is He Zhu, I graduated from University of Ottawa majoring in electrical and computer engineering. I have work with OTT Financial Group for 1 year as a software developer. 
     
     I mainly dedicated myself in back-end java development, I have developed bunch of new features in one of our mobile project "OTT Pocket" which is a online shopping plateform that sells giftcard, voucher and coupon. What's more, back into few month before, I was assigned to be the tech lead, leading a small team to develop a new SaaS platform called PREKA, it stands for present card and prepaid card. The PREKA is designed for issuing business giftcard / voucher / coupon for our partner merchants, which could be bought and redeemed in OTT pocket which make it a full cycle of business. I mainly responsible for developing the backend server-side application, our tech stack includes SpringBoot, SpringCloud that uses the methodology of micro-services and distribute system. My daily works are creating APIs and test it with front-end developers, I also help the team to set up the cloud server AWS EC2 for deployment. 
     ```

   - ```
     I am passionate, hard-working, and extremely responsible. I am also looking forward to putting to practice all the things I learned during my time at university.
     ```

2. **What are your biggest strengths?**

   - ![top strengths for different fields](https://cdn-blog.novoresume.com/articles/interview-questions-and-best-answers-guide/top-strengths-for-different-fields.png)

   - ```
     My biggest strength is that I’m good at picking up new skills. As the technologies are changing so fast, you should always stay hungry to learn new things. For myself, apart from the basic knowledge of programming learned in university, all the tech stacks I am using right now was learned just 1 years ago. 
     
     With an incresing number of customers in our app, I have integrated many new techs in our app. for example, some high-efficient middleware, payment plugins, AWS SDKs and so on. what's more, since we are only a small team, developers also play a role of DevOps that deploy and matain the applications. As a result, we learn how to configure and deploy a project in the server and use different tools to make it robust and fast, such as docker, nginx, ...
     ```

   - ```
     My biggest strength is that I’m very efficient at working under pressure. No matter the crisis or stress, I can make the right decisions on-the-spot.
     
     One time close the publish date of the new release, my front-end developer got sick and could finished the job on time. There was no other developers that are free to do these new functions. At that point, things looked so bleak that my supervisor even considered to postpone the release date. Instead, as I have already finshed my part of job and I kinda want to learn more front-end techs, I took three days to complete the job that ensured we could publish our APP on time, I think I have a better understanding of how it works and also strengthen my coding ability.

**Facing a Problem and how to solve it**

- ```java
  There was a problem that happened internally in "OTT Pocket" that our clearing and settlement were calculated mannually by the operation team and it is very time-consuming especially when the transaction amount it high. One time, they made a mistake and cause severe problem, So I proposed to automate the whole process and discussed with my product team. I led the team to design the clearing procedure and backend data structure, the sprint last about about two weeks including testing time. Finally, the new function goes online successfully and the operation team can export the settlement report by just clicking a button.

# Types of Design Patterns

## 1. Creational

> Creational design patterns relate to **how objects are constructed from classes** (如何创建实例). New-ing up objects may sound trivial but unthoughtfully littering code with object instance creations can lead to headaches down the road. The creational design pattern come with powerful suggestions on how best to encapsulate the object creation process in a program.

- Builder Pattern
- Prototype Pattern
- Singleton Pattern
- Abstract Factory Pattern

## 2. Structural

> Structural patterns are concerned with the **composition of classes** (如何构建类) i.e. how the classes are made up or constructed. 

- Adapter Pattern
- Bridge Pattern
- Composite Pattern
- Decorator Pattern
- Facade Pattern
- Flyweight Pattern
- Proxy Pattern

## 3. Behavioral

> Behavioral design patterns dictate the **interaction of classes and objects** (类与实例的交互) amongst eachother and the **delegation of responsibility** (责任授权). 

- Interpreter Pattern
- Template Pattern
- Chain of Responsibility Pattern
- Command Pattern
- Iterator Pattern
- Mediator Pattern
- Memento Pattern
- Observer Pattern
- State Pattern
- Strategy Pattern
- Visitor Pattern

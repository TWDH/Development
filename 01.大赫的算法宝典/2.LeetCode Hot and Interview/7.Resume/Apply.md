    SQUARE - Cash APP
    I believe in Cash App's business model which is powered by Square provides an efficient way to send, spend, transfer and invest for individual customers. From my previous work experience with the Fintech company, I have integrated our mobile app with Square VISA/MasterCard payment API, which is very powerful and convenient among the payment processing companies. A big amount of our merchants who use our payment channels (WeChat, Alipay, UnionPay) are also a customer of Square as the credit card payment channel. The register, terminal, and other hardware are very impressive. I also believe in the company's future is quite promising that it not only provides an affordable solution to small businesses group but also considers the requirements of individuals. As I have experience with Fintech and E-Commerce, it's a great match and I'm looking forward to continuing to make contributions to the financial industry.

    Omnipresent
    I believe in Omnipresent's service which makes it easy to hire, pay and provide support to the international team. The business model is the pioneer in this field and has only a few competitors on the market. From my previous work experience with different companies, big employers always would like to hire high-quality people from all over the world. To realize it, it's often costly to establish an office in the other part of the earth. With the help of Omnipresent, I can see the problem has another solution that is efficient and convenient. With the extensive onhand experience in real industrial work, I think is a great match between us and would like to make a contribution to the company.

# Code

**Enums and Constants:** Here are the required enums, data types, and constants:

- ```java
  public enum FlightStatus{
      ACTIVE,
      SCHEDULED,
      DELAYED,
      DEPARTED,
      LANDED,
      IN_AIR,
      ARRIVED,
      CANCELLED,
      DIVERTED,
      UNKNOWN
  }
  
  public enum PaymentStatus{
      UNPAID,
      PENDING,
      COMPLETED,
      FILLED,
      DECLINED,
      CANCELLED,
      ABANDONED,
      SETTLING,
      SETTLED,
      REFUNDED
  }
  
  public enum ReservationStatus{
      REQUESTED,
      PENDING,
      CONFIRMED,
      CHECKED_IN,
      CANCELLED,
      ABANDONED
  }
  
  public enum SeatClass {
      ECONOMY,
      ECONOMY_PLUS,
      PREFERRED_ECONOMY,
      BUSINESS,
      FIRST_CLASS
  }
  
  public enum SeatType {
      REGULAR,
      ACCESSIBLE,
      EMERGENCY_EXIT,
      EXTRA_LEG_ROOM
  }
  
  public enum AccountStatus{
      ACTIVE,
      CLOSED,
      CANCELED,
      BLACKLISTED,
      BLOCKED
  }
  
  public class Address {
      private String streetAddress;
      private String city;
      private String state;
      private String zipCode;
      private String country;
  }
  ```

**Account, Person, Customer and Passenger:** These classes represent the different people that interact with our system:

- ```java
  // For simplicity, we are not defining getter and setter functions. The reader can
  // assume that all class attributes are private and accessed through their respective
  // public getter method and modified only through their public setter method.
  
  public class Account {
      private String id;
      private String password;
      private AccountStatus status;
  
      public boolean resetPassword();
  }
  
  public abstract class Person {
      private String name;
      private Address address;
      private String email;
      private String phone;
  
      private Account account;
  }
  
  public class Customer extends Person {
      private String frequentFlyerNumber;
  
      public List<Itinerary> getItineraries();
  }
  
  public class Passenger {
      private String name;
      private String passportNumber;
      private Date dateOfBirth;
  
      public String getPassportNumber() {
          return this.passportNumber;
      }
  }
  ```

**Airport, Aircraft, Seat and FlightSeat:** These classes represent the top-level classes of the system:

- ```java
  public class Airport {
      private String name;
      private Address address;
      private String code;
  
      public List<Flight> getFlights();
  }
  
  public class Aircraft {
      private String name;
      private String model;
      private int manufacturingYear;
      private List<Seat> seats;
  
      public List<FlightInstance> getFlights();
  }
  
  public class Seat {
      private String seatNumber;
      private SeatType type;
      private SeatClass _class;
  }
  
  public class FlightSeat extends Seat {
      private double fare;
      public double getFare();
  }
  ```

**Flight Schedule classes, Flight, FlightInstance, FlightReservation, Itinerary:** Here are the classes related to flights and reservations:

- ```java
  public class WeeklySchedule {
      private int dayOfWeek;
      private Time departureTime;
  }
  
  public class CustomSchedule {
      private Date customDate;
      private Time departureTime;
  }
  
  public class Flight {
      private String flightNumber;
      private Airport departure;
      private Airport arrival;
      private int durationInMinutes;
  
      private List<WeeklySchedules> weeklySchedules;
      private List<CustomSchedules> customSchedules;
      private List<FlightInstance> flightInstances;
  }
  
  public class FlightInstance {
      private Date departureTime;
      private String gate;
      private FlightStatus status;
      private Aircraft aircraft;
  
      public bool cancel();
      public void updateStatus(FlightStatus status);
  }
  
  public class FlightReservation {
      private String reservationNumber;
      private FlightInstance flight;
      private Map<Passenger, FlightSeat> seatMap;
      private Date creationDate;
      private ReservationStatus status;
  
      public static FlightReservation fetchReservationDetails(String reservationNumber);
      public List<Passenger> getPassengers();
  }
  
  public class Itinerary {
      private String customerId;
      private Airport startingAirport;
      private Airport finalAirport;
      private Date creationDate;
      private List<FlightReservation> reservations;
  
      public List<FlightReservation> getReservations();
      public boolean makeReservation();
      public boolean makePayment();
  }
  ```

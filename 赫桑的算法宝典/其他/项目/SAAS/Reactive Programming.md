# Reactive

- Reactive systems have certain characteristics that make them ideal for **low-latency, high-throughput** workloads. 
- Project Reactor and the Spring portfolio work together to enable developers to build enterprise-grade reactive systems that are **responsive, resilient, elastic, and message-driven**.

### What is reactive processing?

- Reactive processing is a paradigm that enables developers build **non-blocking, asynchronous** applications that can handle **back-pressure** (flow control).

### Why use reactive processing?

- Reactive systems better utilize modern processors. Also, the inclusion of back-pressure in reactive programming ensures better resilience between decoupled components.
